# Blockfolio CLI

Unofficial Blockfolio CLI that shows your current portfolio value.

## Installation

Download `blockfolio` and put it in a folder that's in your `PATH` env var, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

Make sure it's executable - `chmod 755 blockfolio`.

Get your Device ID from the Blockfolio app. Go to Settings, tap "Copy Device ID".

Set it as the `BLOCKFOLIO_ID` environment variable.

e.g. `export BLOCKFOLIO_ID='f12345xxxxx'`

Then just run `blockfolio`.
